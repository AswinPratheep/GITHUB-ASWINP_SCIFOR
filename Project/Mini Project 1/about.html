        <p style="color: goldenrod; text-align: center;">At Titan, we take immense pride in crafting the best-in-class watches that are designed to stand the test of time. As we strive to ensure a trustworthy shopping experience for our customers, it is important to note that sale of counterfeit products is illegal. However, we've noticed that there are counterfeit products being sold in the market, and we take this matter very seriously.

            Counterfeit products are fake copies of the original products that are designed to deceive customers into believing that they are purchasing genuine products. Unfortunately, these counterfeit products are usually of inferior quality and can cause problems to customers.
            
            Counterfeiters often use low-quality materials and substandard manufacturing processes, which can result in watches that may break or malfunction easily. These watches may also contain harmful chemicals or materials, which can cause skin irritation, allergies, or other health problems. In addition, counterfeit watches don't come with after-sales support and warranty that authentic Titan watches offer. So, if a customer encounters any issues with their counterfeit watch, they won't be able to get any support or repair services from Titan.
            
            Here are some things to keep in mind when identifying counterfeit watches:
            
            Price: If the price seems too good to be true, it probably isn't authentic. Counterfeiters will often sell their watches at much lower price than the authentic watches, which is a clear indication that something is amiss.
            Packaging: Check the packaging carefully. Often counterfeit watches will come in packaging that looks similar to the real thing but with small differences, such as the font or the logo.
            Quality: Titan watches are built to last, so if the quality of the watch seems poor or feels cheap, it's likely a counterfeit.
            Warranty: All Titan watches come with a warranty. If the seller cannot provide a warranty or offers a warranty that seems questionable, it's likely that the product is counterfeit.
            Unique Identification: All our genuine watches come with a ?Unique Identification Number? embossed on the back cover of the watch or remain there in the form of a ?QR Code?.
            We need your help to protect the Titan brand. If you come across any suspicious activity, we urge you to report it to us immediately by writing to customercare@titan.co.in. Please share this information with your friends and family so that they too can avoid counterfeit products and enjoy the quality and trust of Titan.
